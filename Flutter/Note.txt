1) What is HotRestart and HotReload in Flutter ?
HotReload:
- instantly see the effects of code changes, without needing to restart it.
- updates running app, but doesn't restart it, and the app state is preserved.
- particularly useful for tweaking UI elements

HotRestart:
- more extensive than Hot Reload. start at run build method.
- Resets the Flutter app and rebuilds the entire widget tree, effectively restarting the app.
- Still much faster than a full restart. When trigger Hot Restart, the app's state is not preserved.
- useful when changes made to the app's state or initialization code need to be tested,  
- as it provides a clean start without completely stopping and restarting the development server.
